Note that *interests* here denotes concepts at the level below the grand super-categories that are often top-level in knowledge graphs. That is, things like religion, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, computer science, and so on.

In some cases these are added as tags to pages. It would be a waste of time to replace these well-established and well-known groupings as pages themselves. Better to focus on the connections between concepts of at least some more specificity.
