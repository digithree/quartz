The association of earthly royal power and the divine is so ancient, and its assumptions so deep, it is difficult to determine its origin.

In a way, it seems too obvious to ask after. And yet, it is a question that has obsessed me for years now: why must the divine be a ruler?

# Questions

* How did the first kings emerge?
* How was their dominion justified?
* Why are the gods (or a single god) most often royal and ruling?
* Did early (human) kingdoms make conceptualising all reality as ordered by a divine king seem obvious?
* Or, were the first monarchies ordained by divine rule, as adherents and believers have claimed?
* How then does organised spirituality and religion appear in places without such social structures, no less in our own time in the West of social democracy and capitalism?
