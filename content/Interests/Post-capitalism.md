# The Future

Who knows what the future will bring?

## Utopia

Often Leftist writers speak about the utopia that will be the post-capitalist world. But will it necessarily be so?

# The Present

Some say capitalism is has already ended or morphed into something distinctly different.

## Techno-feudalism

A reversion to the pre-capitalist order but with the new capabilities of modern technology.

The key features are:

* The charging of rents, not the extraction of profit
* Extensive hierarchies of useless retainers, i.e. executives, managers, consultants as like "lords, vassals, and retainers". ([[Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber]], p. 191)
