# Reframing the present

Some argue that capitalism has already ended or morphed into something distinctly different.

## Techno-feudalism

A reversion to the pre-capitalist order but with the new capabilities of modern technology.

The key features are:

* The charging of rents, not the extraction of profit (or at least eclipsing profit as the dominant economic force)
* Extensive hierarchies of useless retainers, i.e. executives, managers, consultants as like "lords, vassals, and retainers". ([[Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber]], p. 191)
* Or, vassals as those still operating as capitalists within the "cloud fiefs" of the "cloudalists" (Yanis Varoufakis' term of digital cloud platform techno-feudal lords), i.e. Samsung is the vassal of Google the techno-feudal lord of its Android cloud fief. ([[TechnoFeudalism by Yanis Varoufakis]])
