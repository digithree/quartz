title: The Quotidian
---
**Quotidian** means *ordinary* or having the quality of *occurring daily*. That is, unremarkable in the sense of being 'everyday'.  But what happens every day must not necessarily imply a lack of importance or of being boring and inconsequential.

What we do regularly is what shapes us and the source of a powerful, steady creativity. That is the expressed throughout this personal website as I collect and link my various projects and ideas.

On this website you'll find information about who I am and my various projects.
Most of what I create is available for free as online articles, PDFs, open source code, or freely downloadable music.
