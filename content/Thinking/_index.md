title: Thinking

I've decided to refer to this micro-blog (are people still using that term?) the _Thinking_ section. For me it's a kind of replacement for social media, a short to medium form of provisional writing that is anywhere between a shower though at a polished essay.

In the spirit of sociability, feel free to drop an email to [simonkenny@duck.com](mailto:simonkenny@duck.com), especially if it is in reaction to anything here.
