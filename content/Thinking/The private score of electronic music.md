In [What Is Classical Music?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/aucoin-what-is-classical-music/682119/), an interesting answer is proposed:

> At its core, classical music isn't "classical." It is written music.

This is a clever solution to sidestep the tedious (and likely impossible) task of setting some boundary to enclose the diverse styles of music played under that umbrella term. Of course, all categories break down under scrutiny (as Wittgenstein would have it, members bear more of a family resemblance, see also [[Metamodernism by Jason Ananda Josephson Storm]]) and yet such categories persist as useful shorthand. These are things that we "know when we see them", but, as the author of the article agrees, that attitude doesn't satisfy.

I like this definition and the author builds their case well, distinguishing it from popular contemporary music which lives in its recorded state and from folk music which is primarily aural (though this last comparison is a little underdeveloped in the piece).

What it brings to mind for me is the production and reproduction of *electronic music*. This genre doesn't receive and explicit treatment but I would see it as distinct from music which is typically played by hand and recorded in the studio. Of classical music, the author says:

> If we let ourselves be guided by this basic question—which musical artists regard the score as a creative starting point?—we arrive at the broadest and most welcoming definition of "classical" music.

Electronic music, especially of the most intense and cerebral kinds, are born in their score. The composition medium is the computer interface, not pen and paper (but then modern "classical" scored works are also written on computer, at least eventually). It is also a *private score*, generally closely guarded and not shared. A notable exception that proves this rule is *deadmau5*, who has been very open about their production techniques, but his approach is unusual.

For a look at some popular music software, check out [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/), the one I used the most about [[Music#Bitwise Operator|10 years ago]], as well as [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) which I used when I was getting started 25 years ago ([deadmau5 was also an early adopter](https://www.image-line.com/artists/deadmau5-joel-zimmerman)). [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) comes free with Mac computers and its more grown up cousin [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) is widely used.

For a brief forensic analysis of the premier artist of the genre, I highly recommend this YouTube video discussing *Aphex Twin's* software composition tools (no prior knowledge necessary):

I had the unrivalled pleasure of seeing *Aphex Twin* live twice in 2009 as well as *Venetian Snares*, both powerhouses on the record and at the venue and two artists for whom composition is central. Would we call their work "classical" though?

Electronic music *appears* to live primarily in the recorded artefact—disseminated and reaching new fans—just as in other music the author would classify as non-classical, but this is misleading. It is, in fact, primarily a _live_ genre, [originating in clubs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274309/). Though the image of the "bedroom producer" became well-known, even these artists left their caves to blast the masses. I'm thinking here of examples like [Husdon Mohawke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMrWWAY7MJM) and early Dubstep pioneers [Skream and Mala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVMsguwPvU4).

The record (and the prepared fragments played with and remixed live) are a *rendering* of the score, the 'bounce' of the artist's prior composition. Unlike sheet music intended to be played by physical instruments, the score is invariably meticulously concerned with the exact production of sound. And yet! Many modernist, avant-garde and experimental works are so particular in this way. As expected, the category breaks down but this gives us fertile ground on which to discuss.

Electronic music is a hybrid, classical/modern. Scored but rendered to audio. Played live but there instrumented, approximating the 'band' format but more the *DJ as conductor*.
