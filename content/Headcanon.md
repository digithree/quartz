In first days of the new year in 2025, I tried to compile a list of literature that might constitute a kind of canon of world thought, with a Western-centric focus, though not overly or exclusively. It is important to be clear about that — the list does not pretend to be a universal list but it is an attempt at what a well-read English speaker of Western Europe might want to read to be situated within the relevant traditions of thought.
