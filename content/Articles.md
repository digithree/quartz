I've been lucky to have a few articles accepted for publication in recent years. I've also published a small number to a Medium blog, which I will link here also.

## Bandersnatch deep-dive blog

This was an anonymous blog in which I wrote a 5 part exploration of the Black Mirror interactive film Bandersnatch. I kind of method acted the main character at this time and recreated the fictional mission of creating the impossible and maddening titular game, though on Commodore 64 instead of ZX Spectrum.

Instead of reverse chronological order like all the above, this is in reading order, from top to bottom. They were written between February and April 2019.

1. [Unified Theory of Bandersnatch, and why I’ll finish Stephan’s game](https://medium.com/@marshan/unified-theory-of-bandersnatch-and-why-ill-finish-stephan-s-game-5e3253973e34)
2. [How to play Bandersnatch as a game, and what that means](https://medium.com/@marshan/how-to-play-bandersnatch-as-a-game-and-what-that-means-ebf47c6d4b7f)
3. [Congruences between Bandersnatch and other Black Mirror episodes](https://medium.com/@marshan/congruences-between-bandersnatch-and-other-black-mirror-episodes-363f87bc4dd5)
4. [Bandersnatch, clues of the game in Stefan’s flowcharts](https://medium.com/@marshan/bandersnatch-clues-of-the-game-in-stefans-flowcharts-97b01234f9c2)
5. [Bandersnatch for C64 v0.1: the story so far](https://medium.com/@marshan/bandersnatch-for-c64-v0-1-the-story-so-far-985287305055)

Like the protagonist 'Stefan', my game remains unfinished, though my sanity returned to me as soon as I stopped working on it and no dad's heads were chopped off in the making.

You can download and play the working demo game at [BNDRSNTCH](https://github.com/digithree/bndrsntch). See also in [[Game Design]].
