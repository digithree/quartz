```poetry
Silence is withholding, impossibly numb,
A stopping of breath, the coming gasp.
The closed eye sets loose a restless gaze
On frozen rocks of passing sights.
In dream only, an inward sounding,
The ear clings high and casts about.
Quiet is inviting, gently felt.
Attend in answer the light, loud wind.
