# Themes

A take on a [[Post-modernism#Metamodernism]] (obviously), solving for the philosophical and especially highly criticized academic aspects, not in terms of the current art and media era. For that, see [[Metamodernism by Robin Van Den Akker et al]] (confusingly the same title, though different subtitle).
