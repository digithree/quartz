# Notes

## On the [[Problem of Elite Knowledge]]

And the invention of gods.

> There are, however, but few mature minds in the world; and thus it was that the philosophic-religious doctrines of the [ancient] pagans were divided to mete the needs of these two fundamental groups of human intellectâ€”one philosophic, the other incapable of appreciating the deeper mysteries of life. To the discerning few were revealed the _esoteric_, or spiritual, teachings, while the unqualified many received only the literal, or _exoteric_, interpretations. In order to make simple the great truths of Nature and the abstract principles of natural law, the vital forces of the universe were personified, becoming the gods and goddesses of the ancient mythologies. While the ignorant multitudes brought their offerings to the altars of Priapus and Pan (deities representing the procreative energies), the wise recognized in these marble statues only symbolic concretions of great abstract truths.
