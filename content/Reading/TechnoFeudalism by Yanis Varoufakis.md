# Themes

A major contributor to the political theory of [[Post-capitalism#Techno-feudalism]], not coining it but making it central, of course.

The text coins several neologisms, most of them extremely awkward:

* Technofeudalism, "the triumph of rent over profit." [Ch. 4] (not original, but defined and defended) 
* Cloud capital, a quasi-self-reproducing form of capital due to attention capture of digital subjects, who are manipulated via their attention to become brand locked in consumers in faux-marketplaces and social media digital zones
* Cloudalist, the owners of the cloud platforms — not the infrastructure as such (as an engineer would understand it)
* Cloud proles, "waged workers driven to their physical limits by cloud-based algorithm" [Ch. 3]
* Cloud serfs, those performing unpaid labour as users of cloud capital platforms

# Notes

## It's techno-fiefdoms, stupid

> It is tempting to think that it does not really matter what we call the system we live in. Technofeudalism or hyper-capitalism, the system is what it is, whatever the word we use to describe it. Tempting perhaps, but quite wrong. ...  
> ...something critically important would have been lost if those who forged the language of that era [of early capitalism in which Marx etc. lived] had been reluctant to ditch the word feudalism, choosing to call the nascent system not capitalism but industrial or market feudalism. By boldly calling it capitalism, a century before capital had fully dominated our societies, they opened humanity’s eyes to the great transformation unfolding around them as it was happening.
> ...just as in the 1770s, to describe today’s nascent system in the terms of the past – to call it hyper-capitalism, or platform capitalism, or rentier capitalism – would be not just a failure of the imagination but to miss the great transformation of our society that is currently taking place. [Ch. 5]

In this, the author implicitly dismisses the work of Srnicek and Zuboff in their qualified capitalism, 'platform capitalism' and 'surveillance capitalism' respectively (more on these connections throughout) in favour of his preferred *techno-feudalism*.

He also defends the power of naming, as in the widely accepted psychological healing and understanding technique of "Name it to tame it", even the spiritual and magical history of naming. "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet" perhaps, but perhaps not be well understood as rosey.

The author also defends the new term on the grounds that loss-leaders like Amazon Alexa and Google Home devices are not about creating profit on their sale but a gambit to entrap their users more deeply within the digital spaces in which they can charge rent.

He also dismisses the idea that there is true *capitalist* competition, even between 'cloudalists' (cloud platform owners and operators) Rather, what we see are territorial wars that were also common in the feudal era. On this, it gets somewhat shaky, but there is a reasonableness to it too.

## Cloud capital

> Every time we go online to enjoy the services of these algorithms, we have no option but to cut a Faustian deal with their owners. To use the personalised services their algorithms provide, we must submit to a business model based on the harvesting of our data, the tracking of our activity, the invisible curating of our content. Once we have submitted to this, the algorithm goes into the business of selling things to us while selling our attention to others. At that point something more profound kicks in which gives the algorithm’s owners immense power – to predict our behaviours, to guide our preferences, to influence our decisions, to change our minds, to thereby reduce us to their unpaid servants, whose job is to provide our information, our attention, our identity and above all the patterns of behaviour that train their algorithms. [Ch. 3]

This is exactly what was described in [[Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek]], here under a new term. Varoufakis will later defend the need for his term and how techno-feudalism is different even from capitalism to retire the term. It is also what was described in [[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff]] with no significant difference in detail.

How is cloud capital different?

> Here is a glimpse of what makes cloud capital so fundamentally new, different and scary: capital has hitherto been reproduced within some labour market – within the factory, the office, the warehouse.  
> Aided by machines, it was waged workers who produced the stuff that was sold to generate profits, which in turn financed their wages and the production of more machines – that’s how capital accumulated and reproduced. Cloud capital, in contrast, can reproduce itself in ways that involve no waged labour. How? By commanding almost the whole of humanity to chip in to its reproduction – for free! [Ch. 3]

## The Cloudalists

> Like all capital since capitalism’s inception, cloud capital can be thought of as a vast production and behaviour-modification machine: it produces marvellous devices and the power (for its owners) to command humans who do not own it. But that’s where the similarity between terrestrial and cloud capital ends and where the difference between conventional capitalists and cloudalists begins. [Ch. 3]

Again, this is what Zuboff called 'surveillance capitalism'.

## Cloud proles

> Cloud proles – my term for waged workers driven to their physical limits by cloud-based algorithms – suffer at work in ways that would be instantly recognised by whole generations of earlier proletarians.  
> ...  
> Algorithms have already replaced bosses in the transport, deliveries and warehousing sectors. And workers forced to work for these algorithms find themselves in a modernist nightmare: some non-corporeal entity that not only lacks but is actually incapable of human empathy allocates them work at a rate of its choosing before monitoring their response times. Released from any of the qualms even inhumane humans harbour, the algo-bosses are at liberty to reduce the workers’ paid hours, to increase their tempo to insanity-inducing levels, or to turn them out onto the street for ‘inefficiency’. At that point, the workers sacked by the algorithm are thrown into a Kafkaesque spiral, unable to speak to a human capable of explaining why they were fired. [Ch. 3]

This is gig work, split-shift work, etc., abstracted out to the common denominator, control of work scheduling, conditions and other factors by automated, algorithmic means.

## Cloud serfs

> Consider what cloud capital consists of: smart software, server farms, cell towers, thousands of miles of optic fibre. And yet all of this would be worthless without ‘content’. The most valuable part of the stock of cloud capital is not its physical components but rather the stories posted on Facebook, the videos uploaded to TikTok and YouTube, the photos on Instagram, the jokes and insults on Twitter, the reviews on Amazon or, simply, our movement through space, allowing our phones to alert Google Maps to the latest spot of traffic.  
> In providing these stories, videos, photos, jokes and movements, it is we who produce and reproduce – outside any market – the stock of cloud capital. [Ch. 3]

How is this connected to the historical life of the 'serf'?

> ...at the end of the harvest, the [feudal] landlord would send the sheriff to extract the lion’s share of [the serfs] produce – without paying the serfs a penny for it. So it goes with the billions of us unwittingly producing cloud capital. The fact that we do so voluntarily, happily even, does not detract from the fact that we are unpaid manufacturers – cloud serfs whose daily self-directed toil enriches a tiny band of multibillionaires residing mostly in California or Shanghai. [Ch. 3]

## Rents make it techno-feudalism

> Before 2008, when capitalism still relied on profit as its motive power, it would not have been possible for such a scheme to be generalised ... This is what gave Adam Smith his optimism about capitalism: his faith that capitalist profit would continue to triumph over feudal rent. In reality, since Smith wrote his famous lines in the 1770s, rent has survived and even prospered under capitalism. Cartels, consumer gouging, the technostructure’s successful manufacturing of desires for things we do not need, financialised asset-stripping – all of these practices have generated increasing rents within capitalism. Nevertheless, Smith’s optimism was supported by the bigger picture: rent survived only parasitically on, and in the shadows of, profit. That changed after 2008.  
> ...  
> I can almost hear Smith’s voice, which I imagine with a tinge of a Scottish accent, lamenting that after 2008, and in the name of saving capitalism, central banks snuffed out capitalism’s dynamism and advantage. I can imagine his dismay that harmful, quasi-feudal rent got a chance to exact a historic revenge on fruitful capitalist profit, with profit-seeking consigned to the aspirant petty bourgeois while the truly rich gleefully whisper to one another that profit is for losers. [Ch. 4]

The author's argument is that the banking, financing system with the stock markets collude in pooling their money together to effective make this a rent extraction system (feudalism), not a system of profile extraction (capitalism). Incidently, he does this, as a libertarian socialist, while able to have it both ways and praise at least the dynamism and distributed capital ownership that he imagines pre-2008 capitalism to have been.

But what is the different between profit and rent?

> Arithmetically, there is no difference: both rent and profit amount to money left over once costs are paid for. The difference is subtler, qualitative, almost abstract: profit is vulnerable to market competition, rent is not. The reason is their different origins. Rent flows from privileged access to things in fixed supply, like fertile soil or land containing fossil fuels; you cannot produce more of these resources, however much money you might invest in them. Profit, in contrast, flows into the pockets of entrepreneurial people who have invested in things that would not have otherwise existed – things like Edison’s light bulb or Jobs’s iPhone.  
> ...  
> Capitalism prevailed when profit overwhelmed rent, a historic triumph coinciding with the transformation of productive work and property rights into commodities to be sold via labour and share markets respectively. ... Nevertheless, despite profit’s triumph, rent survived capitalism’s golden age... [however] some rentiers not only survived but, in fact, flourished by feeding on the generous scraps left in profit’s wake. ... What all these mega-rentiers have in common is a strong motive to legitimise their rents by disguising them as profits – something akin to profit-washing their rents. [Ch. 5]

Then, renting is selling access to a fixed asset without any incentive to improve quality or perform any maintenance beyond the minimum. Variously, the author pains rent-based economic systems as stagnant, something I have read elsewhere, and buys into the idea of the dynamism of profit within capitalism. He seems to believe in a kind of cooperative libertarian capitalism as the best system (and closes out the book with an extended thought experiment in his blockchain inspired utopia that is allegorized in another of his books, [[Another Now by Yanis Varoufakis|Another Now]]).

After this, the author again uses the _platforms_ of (what is more widely understood to be) modern digital capitalism to argue that those platforms constitute the new commons of the internet (as none are possible without it) which is enclosed and rents charged on it.

The case study is Apple, its iPhone and supporting App Store, and Google's Android as copycat, funded by its search empire:

> To be competitive, Apple’s unwaged third-party developers, mainly partnerships or small capitalist firms, had no choice but to operate via the Apple Store. The price? A 30 per cent ground rent, paid to Apple on all their revenues. Thus a vassal capitalist class grew from the fertile soil of the first cloud fief: the Apple Store.
> ...  
> The result was a global smartphone industry with two dominant cloudalist corporations, Apple and Google, with the bulk of their wealth being produced by unwaged third-party developers, from whose sales they extracted a fixed cut. This is not profit. It is cloud rent, the digital equivalent of ground rent. [Ch. 5]

It is a compelling case, I'll put a [[Pin 📌]] here to do a deeper dive into [[Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek]] and see if they say anything differently. I have a feeling they do not and it is the same argument.

## Enclosure of the internet commons

> And so it was that, decoupled from the mundane world of physical capital, legitimised by the ideology of neoliberalism, fuelled by a new virtue called ‘greed’, shrouded in the complexity of their computers, financiers reinvented themselves – not without some justification – as masters of the universe. In that universe, where algorithms had already become the financiers’ handmaidens, the original, commons-like, internet stood no chance. New Enclosures were only a matter of time.  
> As with the original Enclosures, some form of fence would be necessary to keep the masses out of such an important resource. In the eighteenth century, it was land that the many were denied access to. In the twenty-first century, it is access to our own identity. [Ch. 2]

If we set aside the hyperbole of calling greed a "new virtue", this is an interesting idea, that identity management becomes a new way to create informational enclosures.

See also the excellent exposition of historic enclosure of common land to create private property, and the parallels with _intellectual_ property, in [[The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor]].

## How to unseat the techno-feudal lords

> The great new barrier is the physical isolation of cloud serfs and cloud proles from one another. ... But herein lies the great power that cloud capital presents to its potential rebels: a capacity to build coalitions, organise and take action via the cloud. [Ch. 7]

The author speculates that massive, multi-million person coordinated collective action would be needed to damage and ultimately repurpose — not destroy or take down — for the common good. This is a seizing and occupying of the digital 'lands' of "cloud capital", the property, that has much in common with previous communist revolution.

> Even if [strike and boycott action] were only mildly successful, causing say a 10 per cent drop in Amazon’s usual revenues, while Amazon’s warehouse strike disrupted deliveries for twenty-four hours, such action might prove enough to push Amazon’s share price down in ways that no traditional labour action could achieve.  
> This is how cloud proles and cloud serfs can unite effectively. It’s what I call *cloud mobilisation*.
> ...  
> Naturally, actions of this sort against one or even several major cloudalist enterprises won’t be enough. The cloud rebellion I envision will need to recruit to its cause many diverse constituencies...  
> None of this is either easy or inevitable. But is it harder or less likely than what the miners, the seamstresses and the dockworkers envisioned and sacrificed their very lives to achieve in the nineteenth century? The cloud takes – but the cloud also gives to those who want to reclaim freedom and democracy. It is up to them, to us, to decide, and to prove, which is greater. [Ch. 7]

Varoufakis ends his book (appendix excluded) with a pithy take on Marx and Engels' famous rally cry from *The Communist Manifesto*:

> Cloud serfs, cloud proles and cloud vassals of the world, unite! We have nothing to lose but our mind-chains! [Ch. 7]

The inclusion of "cloud vassals" here is interesting. The original Manifesto quote of course was simply directed at "workers". Here, Varoufakis is encouraging class alignment between workers, consumers and incumbent capitalists of the order below behemoth level. Perhaps strategic?

## [[Another Now by Yanis Varoufakis|Another Now]], a post-crypto utopia

In the final chapter 7, Varoufakis summarizes the plausible utopia he laid out in a previous book called [[Another Now by Yanis Varoufakis|Another Now]]. These are:

* Democratised companies
* Democratised money
* The cloud and the land as a commons

Although these sections are preceded by a section called *Crypto's False Promise*, the influence of blockchain politics is clear. His plan reads like many such documents I encountered in the heyday of crypto when the energy for blockchain-based communities was a frisson. The feeling at the time was that the perfect community could be socially engineered, its strictures baked into the fundamental structure of a blockchain, insuring ultimate compliance and fairness. This is seemingly ironic given it attracted so many self-identifying libertarians, but makes more sense when you take into account their right-wing character.

The author admits to being "mesmerised" by the blogpost that started the crypto/blockchain phenomenon by pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Within Varousfakis' theoretical framework of the cloud (and its various awkwardly named denizens) this makes sense since, as he says, "this cloud-based network generates *no* cloud rents." But what happened?

> ...the crypto movement which had also initially attracted anarchists and socialists, became a supremely volatile currency market... Their ideological contempt for fiat, or state-created, money turned out to be a ruse for issuing their own fiat money. By the time, in 2017, one Bitcoin traded for more than $20,000, the early emancipatory promise of crypto had vanished.  
> ...  
> It was inevitable that the moment a cryptocurrency began to succeed as a currency it would stop working like a currency and would turn instead into a pyramid scheme, with its early adopters growing richer as more and more people bought into it. [Ch. 7]

(Writing today on the 14th of June 2025, Bitcoin is trading at over $100,000)

I am sympathetic to this disillusionment as I too had a number of years of deep interest and engagement with crypto. I was attracted by the purported libertarian and direct democracy ethos but found it a haven for would-be technocratic oligarchs, naive right-wing voluntaryists and the desperation of those trying to scheme their way into a financialized world. Now (writing in mid-2025), the hype cycle's gaze has firmly swivelled to artificial intelligence and we barely hear about 'the blockchain' any more.

Returning to Varoufakis' ideal society, there is little point in me reproducing the text here as it is detailed and somewhat technical, best served by reading it in the book. It inspires me to try to [[Game Design|design a game]] for it though, since he has essentially planned his society top-down as a ruleset. This lends it perfectly to reproduction as a simulation strategy game. A quick web search tells me no one has attempted this yet, so it could be a fun [[Idea 💡]] to try when on off-time. I think it would both show what is interesting about such an idea, which is novel (and we shouldn't forget Varoufakis was once the finance minister of the country of Greece!) but also, I believe, probe for the weakness of such an approach for a whole society. But who knows, perhaps it really is a good blueprint.
