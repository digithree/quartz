I am an author, technologist, educator, musician and game designer.

A constant dabbler, I sometimes develop enough competency to make an impact in a strand of interest. It is difficult to avoid wearing these interests as identities and valuing oneself by proxy. At the core, for me, it is just making time to make art, to think and talk, and to dedicate some time to building things, even if only for a season.

## Programming

My most invested in area of expertise is the craft of computer programming, which I have been working at more or less continuously since the age of 8 or 9, 30 years at this point. My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-kenny-55997b81/) is the best place to learn more about my professional career in technology, academic teaching and mentorship whereas my [Github account](https://github.com/digithree) is the home for the rougher and more exploratory work. Much the latter case has been lost or deleted over the years, there's no point in holding on to everything. It's okay to forget some things.

## Work

I currently work for the [ADAPT Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/), based in Trinity College Dublin (Ireland) where I am the senior software architect for the [Precision ALS](https://www.precisionals.ie/) project in partnership with [TRICALS](https://www.tricals.org/). We are developing a platform to make critical research available to better understand this terrible Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

## Writing

In late 2023, my debut book was published, a non-fiction work on the philosophy of religion and spirituality entitled *A Critical Introduction to Tarot: Examining the Nature of a Belief in Tarot*. This was published by Iff Books. I followed this with a pamphlet to expand into areas I didn't have space for originally, especially how modern bespoke spiritualities interact with AI and games. This subsequent pamphlet I titled A Cultural Reader of the Tarot. You can discover more about these works, and download the pamphlet for free, in [[Books]]. I spoke about this journey in [The Challenges of Independent Non-Fiction](https://www.writing.ie/tell-your-own-story/the-challenges-of-independent-non-fiction-by-simon-kenny/).

I'm working on other writing in this area, focusing on cultural criticism and the philosophy of religion and spirituality, as well as technology. Sometimes these happy overlap, such as the most popular article I've ever written: [ChatGPT as Tarot Oracle](https://medium.com/@skenwrites/chatgpt-as-tarot-oracle-1404ef9d200c). Sometimes the clicks are baited unintentionally. I've tied together the strands of my short-form publishing outside this website in the [[Articles]] section.

Another kind of writing I've picked up again this year (2024/25) is poetry. I speak in more detail about what [[Poems]] mean to me in that section of the site. For me, in the capacity I wish to write, they are homemade artworks that beautify the home and give voice to the personally lived.

Simon is a member of the International Playing-Card Society, The Irish Writers Centre, and [Writing.ie](https://www.writing.ie/member-authors/simon-kenny/).

## Music

As a multi-instrumentalist musician and composer, I've been in several bands, worked in theatre and toured internationally. Most of this was in a DIY context, especially my punk, metal and post-rock bands. I learned Indonesian Gamelan and played for many years with local groups. For about 9 years I produced electronic music under solo moniker Bitwise Operator. Almost all this music back catalogue is available free online to listen and, in many case, to download. See [[Music]] for these links and little more information. These days I am learning the Irish flute at a relaxed pace.

## Game design

Game design has to be the least of my competencies and yet is one of my first loves. The reason I started coding as a child was the lure and promise of making my own games. From impossibly hard text adventures to RPGs and strategy games. To an adult observing me at this time it would have been obvious which way my career would go — I spent most of my time coming up with the *systems of the games* and *utilities to support their creation* rather than the games themselves. This is also the reason my writing has never really succeeded in fiction.

You'll find some of my attempts in the [[Game Design]] section.
