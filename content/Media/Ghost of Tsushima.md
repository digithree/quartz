An excellent game, one of the best AAA action games I've ever played.

There is a questionable portrayal of Mongolians as an enemy but on the whole, especially given the state of politics in games, it is relatively complex and interesting.

Especially fun is the stylish homage to Akira Kurosawa samurai films (Seven Samurai, Rashomon), in the sword fight duels.
