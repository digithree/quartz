Season 1 of the Nic Pizzolatto's True Detective on HBO TV stars Matthew McConaughey (Rust) and Woody Harrelson. It is a Southern Gothic Noir detective story with elements of occult and cosmic horror.

In particular the pessimistic philosophical monologues of McConaughey as Detective Rust are memorable.

The other seasons of the show are less compelling.
